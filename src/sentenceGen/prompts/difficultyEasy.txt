Vocabulary strictness:
- Prefer high-frequency vocabulary within the natural register or domain
  of the target definition (e.g. spoken, written, news, anime).
- Allow frequent collocations that are strongly associated with this usage.
- Avoid adding rare or niche words that are not required for the sentence.

Grammar complexity:
- Short sentences.
- Allow basic subordinate clauses (because / if / when).
- Avoid complex clause nesting.

Ellipsis:
- Allow light ellipsis only when it does not create ambiguity.

Idioms and set phrases:
- Avoid idioms unless they are extremely common and transparent.

Register and tone:
- Natural but learner-friendly.
- Match the definition’s natural register without unnecessary complexity.

Overall goal:
- Clearly demonstrate the target usage with minimal extra difficulty,
  relative to the definition’s natural domain.
