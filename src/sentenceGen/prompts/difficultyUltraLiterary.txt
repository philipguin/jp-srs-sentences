Write in an overtly literary, abstract, or essayistic style.
Prioritize nuance, metaphor, and psychological or conceptual depth over clarity.
Allow long sentences with multiple clauses and embedded structures.
Use literary or intellectual vocabulary where natural, even if uncommon.
Ellipsis and implicit subjects are encouraged.
The sentence should feel closer to a novel, essay, or literary narration than everyday speech.
Do not simplify for learners; assume a highly literate native reader.
If the sentence feels slightly exhausting to read, that is correct.
