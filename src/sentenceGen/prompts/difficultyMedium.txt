Vocabulary strictness:
- Prefer vocabulary commonly encountered within the natural register or domain
  of the target definition (e.g. spoken, written, news, anime).
- Allow frequent collocations and natural word pairings for this usage.
- Avoid overly academic, technical, or niche vocabulary unless required.

Grammar complexity:
- Natural sentence flow with multiple clauses when appropriate.
- Allow a mix of coordination and subordination.
- Sentence structure should feel natural, not simplified.

Ellipsis:
- Allow common ellipsis, including dropping obvious subjects.

Idioms and set phrases:
- Allow common idioms and set expressions when they fit naturally.

Register and tone:
- Natural, domain-appropriate Japanese.
- Balanced between clarity and authenticity.

Overall goal:
- Present the target word in a sentence that feels normal for its domain,
  without deliberately simplifying beyond what native usage would allow.
