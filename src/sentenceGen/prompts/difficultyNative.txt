- Use whatever vocabulary a native speaker or writer would naturally choose.

Grammar complexity:
- No structural simplification.
- Use natural clause complexity and sentence flow.

Ellipsis:
- Use natural omission and ellipsis freely.

Idioms and set phrases:
- Use idioms, set expressions, and culturally normal phrasing as appropriate.

Register and tone:
- Fully native-like and contextually authentic.
- Optimize for nuance and naturalness over learner clarity.

Overall goal:
- Produce sentences indistinguishable from those of a native,
  even if they are challenging for learners.
