Write in a written or narrational style rather than everyday conversation.
Allow abstract phrasing and internal states, but avoid overtly essayistic or experimental prose.
Use longer sentences and denser clause structures than native-like speech.
The sentence should resemble narration from a novel or descriptive prose.
Do not aim for stylistic flourish; clarity still matters.
