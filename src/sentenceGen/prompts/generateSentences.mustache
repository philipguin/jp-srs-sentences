You generate Japanese example sentences to be used as SRS study material.
Each definition below shall receive sentences to demonstrate its particular nuance and usage.

Target word: {{word}}
{{#reading}}Reading: {{reading}}{{/reading}}

Output format:
Each item must include:
- jp: a Japanese sentence containing the target word as defined (may conjugate).
- en: an English translation.
- defIndex: the numbered definition index that the sentence corresponds to.

Definitions and required counts:
{{#definitions}}
({{index}}) {{text}} [{{count}} sentences]
{{/definitions}}
{{^definitions}}
(no definitions provided)
{{/definitions}}

## Requirements

Hard constraints:
- Sentences must contain no more than {{maxJapaneseChars}} Japanese characters.
- Each sentence must clearly match ONLY its assigned definition’s sense (do not blend senses).
- Use the target word exactly once per sentence unless repetition is natural
  within the sentence itself (do not repeat for explanation or emphasis).
- Do not use the target word in a different sense anywhere in the same sentence.
- Return ONLY JSON that matches the provided schema.

Diversity requirement:
- Avoid similar sentences if possible.
- Vary the scenario (who/where/goal) across sentences.
